## [How to Solve Programming Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)
- Common Mistakes:  
    - improper allocation of time (most severe)
    - coding before planning 
        - make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it.
    -  trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration
- Simple set of Steps: 
    - Read the problem completely twice.
    - Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
    - Optimize the manual steps.
    - Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
    - Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
    - Optimize the real code.
        - 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3
- Know the following if you expect to be able to solve algorithm type problems:
    - Create a list
    - Sort a list or array
    - Create a map or dictionary
    - Loop through a list, or dictionary
    - Parse strings
    - Convert from string to int, int to string, etc
- Extra tip: Many times you will find that a problem itself involves multiple large steps or is very complicated.  In those instances, you will want to try and find a way to cut the problem directly in half and then following the process above for each half.

## [Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive](https://medium.com/swlh/pretend-your-time-is-worth-1-000-hour-and-youll-become-100x-more-productive-f04628bb3e6d)
- Inspiration Quotes and reminders: 
    - “Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? Would you waste one on being angry?” -Niklas Göke
    - But what if you placed a high value on your time?
    - “Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss
    - “The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.”
    - “Indeed the state of all who are preoccupied is wretched, but the most wretched are those who are toiling not even at their own preoccupations…If such people want to know how short their lives are, let them reflect how small a portion is their own.”
    - “Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.”
 
## [How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)
- “Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” — Steve Jobs
- “The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.” — V. Anton Spraul
- Problem Soving Key Concepts: 
    - Understand
    - Plan
        - Sidenote: Programmers have a great tool to help them with this… Comments!
    - Divide
        - Break each problem into sub-problems
        - Then, connect your sub-problems and solutions 
    - Stuck? 
        - Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
            - “The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to do.”” — Andrew Singer
        - Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
        - Practice 
## [Five Whys and Five Hows](https://asq.org/quality-resources/five-whys)
- When to Use: 
    - Use the five whys technique when you want to push a team investigating a problem to delve into more details of the root causes. The five whys can be used with brainstorming or the cause-and-effect diagram.
    - Use the five hows technique to develop more details of a solution to a problem under consideration. The five hows can be used with brainstorming and a solution-focused cause-and-effect diagram.   
- How to Use
    - Draw a box at the top of a piece of flip chart paper and clearly write down the problem or solution to be explored.
    - Below the statement box draw five lines in descending order.
    - Ask "why" or "how" five times and write the answers on the lines drawn from number one to five.
    - It may take less or more than five times to reach the root cause or solution. 
    - Five whys technique example:
