## Reading, Research, and Discussion
- Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
    - I had to ask myself, what is the difference and benefit for each.  I googled it, lol, and came upon this [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-exactly-does-running-JavaScript-inside-a-browser-and-outside-of-a-browser-mean)discussion that I thought had a very 'smooth brain' answer. 
        - Running JavaScript inside a browser means you are interacting with Web UI (HTML and CSS components) which is displayed on a userâ€™s screen.
        - Running JavaScript without/outside a browser means you are using node.js technology to execute your JavaScript code. This type of usage of javascript typically refers to backend programming where your javascript code will interact with your database and can be used to create RESTful APIs.
- What is the difference between a module and a package?
    - A module is a single file (or files) that are imported under one import and used.  A package is a collection of modules in directories that give a package hierarchy. 
- What does the node package manager do?
    - Node Package Manager (NPM) is a command line tool that installs, updates or uninstalls Node. 
- Provide code snippets showing 3 different ways to export a function from a node module
    - export const, export default, and export {name}
