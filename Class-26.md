# [An intro to Webpack](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-intro-to-webpack-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it-8304ecdc3c60/)
- Webpack is a static module bundler
- Webpack goes through your package and creates what it calls a dependency graph which consists of various modules which your webapp would require to function as expected. Then, depending on this graph, it creates a new package which consists of the very bare minimum number of files required, often just a single bundle.js file which can be plugged in to the html file easily and used for the application.
