### Cloud Databases 
- [MLab](https://www.mlab.com/) - remotely hosted mongoDB systems. Easily setup a free database (or pay for more horsepower). Works great with Heroku
- [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) - Cloud based, highly scalable Mongo DB
- [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) - AWS NoSQL Database. Very highly scalable. Also provides a ‘mongoose’-like ORM called ‘dynamoose’
- [CosmosD](https://cosmos.azure.com/) - The Microsoft Azure equivalent for Atlas and Dynamo
