# Start Methodology Questions 

## 1. Tell me about a time you worked with a difficult team member and how you overcame it.
- Situation 
    - While a amanger for a company I previously worked for, there were two team members that erupted into a heated conversation that quickly turned shouting inappropriate remarks towards one another.  
    - My primary role there was a Queue Manager, so I managed a floor of about 30 people and needed to delegate calls and tickets appropriately, while keeping our SLA (Service Level Agreement) at a certain level
    - I was managing the floor alone while waiting for a second manager to join me in the next half hour
- Task 
    - De-escalate the situation, address and document what was happening, and try to keep those two that were in a confrontation's best interest as well that others were around while taking care of my primary duties 
- Action 
    - asked to seperate the two, and let them know I would be addressing the issue, but to give them some space and a break while I found someone that could temporarily look after the floor for a minute
    - there was a person that was actively training for the position I was in, so asked that they watch the queue for me for a few minutes and let them know direction 
    - met with both individuals to document what happened between them, and discussed that once they were done with a break, if they were willing to continue, I could make sure they were not near eachother, and would have more time to discuss this with the active manager that was returning shortly and our HR representative 
- Result 
    - I was able to de-escalate and address the situation and remove them from one another to breath, as well as hear both sides of what happened to initiate the issue 
    - Notified all parties, including management and HR team of the situation before they came into the office so that they could prepare, and let them know if there was further action that was needed 
    - Though I was a manager, this wasn't necessarily a scope of the job that I was initially hired to do, but wanted to make sure that both people were addressed and heard 

## 2. Tell me something difficult you’ve done.
- Situation 
    - I worked for a department for 'special incidents' at my previous job for a ride-share company, that dealt with issues that were sensitive in nature.  In this case, I was the one assigned to that department for my shift, and was handed a case in which there was a customer concerned that their daughter was not anwering their calls, and their last contact was with a ride that was minutes before. 
- Task 
    - Relay the appropriate information to the parent calling
    - in detail, actively prompt for the appropriate information to locate the ride, and document the entire conversation and interaction  
- Action 
    - delegate the task of asking someone else to followup with our driver in real-time
    - contact local authorities in the event that this was indeed something that needed to be reported
    - followup with the plan on how to move forward internally with this case
- Result 
    -  luckily, we were able to get in contact with all parties involved, found that the daughter had taken another service and that they were able to get home safely 
- Feedback: 
    - phrasing things in certain ways 
    - getting in weeds 

## 3. Tell me about a time someone on your team didn’t complete a task and how you went about it.
- Situation 
    - During a full-stack project with a team of 4 developers in which we needed to utilize an API in some way
    - we created fetchArt, which curated specific images based on a mood, that a user could save to gain a more positive feeling 
    - we had a clear plan of what we needed done for the day and for the deadline to complete our app, however, that day we were still missing most of our front-end design elements to make the site look appealing and that we had needed to truly reach MVP
- Task 
    - How were we going to complete this design, while keeping in mind that the project needed to be cohesive, and that there were multiple pages that needed to be accomplished 
- Action 
    - met with all of our members to re-hash our plan of what our take-home work could be
    - collaborated on how much time each person was able to commit outside of our working hours to make sure that we all weren't burnt out to present this idea 
    - strictly stated who was responsible for what page, and shared contact information to give updates on how to keep the momentum moving and where we would be the next day
- Result 
    - we were able to complete the project in time with a time-crunch, and successfully reached our MVP and our features that we had planned to incorporate together 

- Feedback: 
    - still told a full story
    - 

## 4. Tell me about a time you worked with a good team, what that felt like, and what your part in it was.
- Situation 
    - Our goal as 4 software engineers, was to make a backend project, and build a database, that utilized Twitter's API and was able to tweet specific affirming quotes that we had scraped from a website, so that it could tweet to those who are following, automatically. 
- Task 
    - complete our Minimum Viable Product, and plan out any additional features if we had time, while meeting a deadline to present this project together
- Action 
    - We planned out each feature that we wanted to include, took an entire day to structure out our plan of action and timeline, and research all packages and frameworks that we wanted to utilize 
    - made sure that we applied to all accounts that we needed in order to interact with Twitter and Twilio, which included applying for developer access for those sites and keeping in mind that they would take a certain amount of time to be approved 
- Result 
    - we were able to successfully make our MVP as well as add on additional features that we had previous discussed, and make a fully functioning application that interacted with both Twitter's front-end and utilizing twilio as a bonus
